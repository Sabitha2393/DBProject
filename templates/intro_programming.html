            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module 1: Introduction to Programming</strong><br>
                    <p>This module introduces the basics of programming, including variables, data types, and operators. It is designed to help you understand how computers process information and how you can interact with them using code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module 2: Control Structures</strong><br>
                    <p>In this module, weâ€™ll cover control structures such as loops, if-else statements, and switch cases. These are essential building blocks for creating logic in any program.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming</strong><br>
                    <p>This module introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Understanding OOP is key to writing scalable and maintainable code.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module 4: Data Structures</strong><br>
                    <p>Learn about different data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and hashmaps. This module will teach you how to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Module 5: Algorithms</strong><br>
                    <p>This module explores various algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimizing solutions to common programming problems. It is crucial for developing an analytical approach to problem-solving.</p>
